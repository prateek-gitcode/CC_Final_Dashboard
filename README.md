# CC_Final_Dashboard
# Project Objective:
Develop a comprehensive Credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

# Tech Stack:
Power BI Desktop – Data modeling & interactive visualizations 
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures & calculated columns 
Power Query (M Language) – Data transformation and preprocessing 
SQL – Source data in SQL tables, later imported to PowerBI Desktop

# Data Source:
The dataset is sourced from a SQL Database which contains two Tables:
  Customer Table:
    This table contains demographic and personal information of customers, including their age, gender, number of dependents, education level, marital status, and location details like state and zip code. It also includes lifestyle and financial attributes such as car and      house ownership, income, job type, contact preference, personal loan status, and a customer satisfaction score, helping to create a detailed customer profile.
  Credit Card Table:
    This table provides data on customers' credit card usage and financial behavior. It includes information such as card category, annual fees, activation status, customer acquisition cost, and credit limits. It also captures transaction metrics like total amount and          volume, revolving balance, average utilization ratio, usage type (chip, swipe, online), expense category, interest earned, and delinquency status. These metrics help in analyzing customer spending patterns and credit risk.
